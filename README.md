# AZFleet-Overseas-Bay
The project to continue AZFleet in current Minecraft versions.


This is a new AZFleet project, which is warship construction project in Minecraft.

Each ship is built in the same world

Each folder contatins the sources (such as reference pictures) and saves of the world at different
times of construction of that ship. (so ships built earlier will appear in all the saves of ships built later)

The saves are mostly for Java edition.
